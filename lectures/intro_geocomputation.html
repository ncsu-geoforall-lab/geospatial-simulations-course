<ul>
<li>Numerical simulations: tools for gaining new knowledge - <b>virtual experiments</b>

<li class="fragment">Using modeling to simulate complex spatial processes or behaviors 
under designed set of conditions to gain understanding of the studied phenomenon
<li class="fragment">Diagnostic and predictive modeling
<li class="fragment">Provide information for decision making
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial models</h3>
Geospatial models have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: <b>empirical, spatially averaged, and static</b>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: <b>process-based, distributed, and dynamic </b>with
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time
</ul>
 <p class="fragment">Most models combine both approaches
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental or observed data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
 <li class="fragment">empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations
 <li class="fragment">given sufficient data they can be very accurate (ML, AI) 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: Universal Soil Loss Equation - factors are based on observations, 
but topographic LS factor also represents a special case of stream power </small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Process-based models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">derived from first principles, based on physical laws, 
such as continuity and mass conservation equations
 <li class="fragment">refered to as mechanistic or deterministic models
 <li class="fragment">may include stochastic components
 <li class="fragment">can simulate the process under conditions not previously observed
 <li class="fragment">physics based equations often have empirical parameters
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: surface water flow model is based on St. Venant equation, 
but uses empirical Mannings coefficient for computing flow velocity</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
When performing simulations we need to consider:
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Modeled quantity [units]:</b> water, pollutant, vegetation, population density, individual organism, ... 
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Spatial and temporal scale</b>
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Configuration space and interactions:</b> modeled quantity as function of environmental variables, e.g., topography, land cover, infrastructure... 
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Governing equations or rules:</b> continuity, mass preservation, diffusion, ...
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components</h3>

- see e.g. erosion tutorial
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
 Modeled quantities can be represented by continuous georeferenced fields 
 and to support numerical simulations the fields need to be discretized: 
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially averaged units:</b> discrete polygons (hydrologic units, subwatersheds, hillslope elements) 
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially distributed representation:</b> structured and unstructured meshes, or random particles 
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Modeled quantities can also evolve along networks or represent discrete objects (particles, agents)</p>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Spatially averaged models predict the modeled variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number
 <li>Provide important agreggated information for decision making
</ul>
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially distributed models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict 
the variable at any point in space and the result is continuous field
<li>Results may be spatially averaged and classified to support decision making
</ul>
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Coupled models for simulations of complex systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Continuous time simulations of multiple coupled processes
<li>Coupled models challenges: different spatial and temporal scales, discretization
<li>Examples: SWAT, WEPP: weather, runoff, infiltration, crop growth, soil erosion, pollutant transport
</ul>

   <h3>Static and dynamic models</h3>
<p>Empirical, statistical models - usually steady state
<p>Process-based or hybrid models - capture dynamic processes

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial simulations challenges</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>data intensive - large heterogeneous data sets
 <li>complex, multiscale spatial interactions
 <li>high level of uncertainty and difficult validation
</ul>
<p><small>Physics : predictions at the electronic level are with 6-12 digits accuracy 
Geosciences: 70% differences between measurements and model could be satisfactory</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial simulations accuracy</h3>
<p> Calibration and validation issues:
<ul>
  <li>input and validation data may not available at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution 
  <li> <small>example: we cannot predict rainfall rate at each 100m cell with high accuracy and
we don’t have values of initial soil moisture at sufficient temporal resolution, 
so it is difficult to accurately model infiltration, runoff or sediment flow at any point in space </small>
  <li>process-based distributed models do not necessarily improve accuracy but they provide more information and insight 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial simulations and GIS</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">processing of input parameters, generating scenarios
<li class="fragment">run models
<li class="fragment">analyze the results, provide statistical summaries for dashboards
<li class="fragment">visualization 
<li class="fragment">optimization and decision support 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial simulations and GIS</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><b>workflow using standard GIS tools</b>: simple empirical models with physics based components
<li class="fragment"><b>models fully integrated as modules</b>: complex physics-based or empirical models
<li class="fragment"><b>models linked to GIS as extensions or add-ons</b>: common structure and interface
<li class="fragment"><b>complex modeling systems linked through data</b>: GIS is used for input data processing,
results analysis and visualization, but the model is independent from GIS.
<li class="fragment"><b>complex modeling systems can incorporate selected GIS capabilities</b>
</ul>

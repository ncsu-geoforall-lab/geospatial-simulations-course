<section>
   <h3>Geospatial process models</h3>
<p>Geospatial process models are core tools for simulations.
<p>The models of geophysical, biological and socio-economic processes 
have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: <b>empirical, spatially averaged, and static</b>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: <b>process-based, distributed, and dynamic </b>with
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time
</ul>
 <p class="fragment">Most models combine both approaches
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical models</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental or observed data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
 <li class="fragment">empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations
 <li class="fragment">given sufficient data they can be very accurate (ML, AI) 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: Universal Soil Loss Equation: U = RKLSCP, the factors are based on observations, but topographic LS factor also represents a special case of stream power </small>
<p class="fragment"><small>Provide examples from your research </small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Process-based models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">derived from first principles, based on physical laws, 
such as continuity and mass conservation equations
 <li class="fragment">refered to as mechanistic or deterministic models
 <li class="fragment">may include stochastic components
 <li class="fragment">can simulate the process under conditions not previously observed
 <li class="fragment">physics based equations often have empirical parameters
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: surface water flow model is based on partial differential (St. Venant) equation, 
but uses empirical Mannings coefficient for computing flow velocity</small>
<p class="fragment"><small>Provide examples from your research </small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
<p>
When performing simulations we need to consider:
<ul>
  <li>Modeled quantity:
     <b class="fragment">water depth [m], discharge [m$^3$/s], pollutant concentration[mg/l]</b>
  <li>Spatial and temporal scale:
     <b class="fragment">e.g. modeling a first order stream may require 1m spatial and 1 min temporal resolution</b>
  <li>Configuration space and interactions:
     <b class="fragment">water depth depends on precipitation, topography, soils, land use</b>
  <li>Governing equations:
     <b class="fragment"> continuity equations, diffusion, ... </b>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
 Modeled quantities and environmental variables can be represented by continuous georeferenced fields 
<p>To support numerical simulations these fields need to be discretized: 
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially averaged units:</b> discrete polygons (hydrologic units, hillslope elements, landscape patches) 
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially distributed representation:</b> structured and unstructured meshes, or random particles 
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Modeled quantities can also evolve along networks or represent discrete objects (particles, agents)</p>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
 Spatially averaged models predict the modeled variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially distributed models</h3>
Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict 
the variable at any point in space and the result is continuous field

<section>
   <h3>Coupled models for simulations of complex systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Continuous time simulations of coupled processes
<li class="fragment">problems: different spatial and temporal scales, discretization
<li class="fragment">examples: SWAT, WEPP: weather, runoff, infiltration, crop growth, soil erosion, pollutant transport
<li class="fragment">coupled agent based and continuous field models for complex human - nature systems simulations (MEDLANDS)
</ul>

   <h3>Static and dynamic models</h3>
<p>Empirical, statistical models - usually steady state
<p>Process-based or hybrid models - capture dynamic processes

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial simulations challenges</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">data intensive - large heterogeneous data sets
 <li class="fragment">complex, multiscale spatial interactions
 <li class="fragment">high level of uncertainty and difficult validation
 <li class="fragment">input and validation data may not available at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution 
 <li class="fragment">process-based distributed models do not always improve accuracy but they provide important insight 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Physics : predictions at the electronic level are with 6-12 digits accuracy 
<br>Geosciences: 70% differences between measurements and model could be satisfactory</small>
<br class="fragment"> <small>Example: we cannot predict rainfall rate at each 100m cell with high accuracy and
we don’t have values of initial soil moisture at sufficient temporal resolution, 
so it is difficult to accurately model infiltration, runoff or sediment flow at any point in space </small>

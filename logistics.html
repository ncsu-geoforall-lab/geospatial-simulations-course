    The course follows 
    <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>, where you will find links to the course material for each week.
    Assignment reports, notebooks, presentations and the final paper are submitted through 
    <a class="term-changes" href="https://moodle-courses2425.wolfware.ncsu.edu/course/view.php?id=6228"><b>Moodle</b></a>
    where feedback and grades will be posted following the submission.

<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
Course focus will be on open source software:
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/">GRASS GIS</a>. 
     To help testing and reporting on the current development version
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/">download and install GRASS GIS 8.4.0</a>
for your operating system. On Windows, install the stand-alone package
 <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/ms-windows/#stand-alone">GRASS GIS 8.4.0</a>.
 <li>Python and R which you should have installed already
</ul>
Additional information about software will be provided with the individual assignments.

<h4 id="data">Data</h4>
Links to data are provided on the assignment webpages or included with the notebooks. 
If needed, instructions for downloading the educational GRASS GIS dataset are on the GIS582 
<a href="http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/logistics.html"><b>Course logistics</b></a> 
web page (see the section on Data).

<h4>Assignments</h4>
Assignment submissions will be in the form of brief research papers or notebooks.

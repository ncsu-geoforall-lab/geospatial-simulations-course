<h2>Geospatial Computing and Simulations</h2>
<h3>Course description</h3>

This course focuses on theoretical concepts and computational methods that describe,
represent and simulate the functioning of real-world processes. We define the general
properties of geospatial computing and explain the role of simulations in analysis and
understanding of observed phenomena, testing of hypotheses and theories, and
prediction of spatio-temporal systems behavior. We discuss the current methods
and techniques for simulations using deterministic, stochastic and rule-based models
as well as agent-based simulation of complex systems. Hands-on component of the course
will cover implementation of simulations in GIS and advanced applications driven
the student’s research. Open science tools will be used for assignments.
Prior programming experience is expected.

GIS/MEA582 or equivalent, demonstrated programming experience

<h3>Educational approach</h3>

This course consists of lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, homework assignments,
and a major project. Each week there is a lecture related to the foundations
of geospatial computing and simulations theory, methods, techniques, and research challenges followed by a student lead discussion on assigned readings. The material presented
in the lecture is then explored through hands-on exercises using the technologies
within the College of Natural Resource’s Geovisualization Laboratory and homework
assignments. The important component of the course is a project aligned
with the student’s graduate work focused on designing and implementing working geospatial simulation tool.
<p>
<b>Participation:</b>
Students are required to identify one new or emerging geospatial simulation
technique and prepare a short presentation for the class, possibly including
existing interactive web application. This portion of the course encourages
free exploration of, and creative thinking about, the vast array of emerging
technologies that can be beneficial for student’s research.

<p>
<b>Bi-Weekly Assignments:</b>
There are six assignments developed based on the required
reading and the hands-on exercises. The assignments require
independent work including data processing, visualization, and scientific
writing, beyond what is covered in the lecture portion of the course.

<p>
<b>Project:</b> Throughout the semester, the students develop and
implement a geospatial simulation tool using one of the techniques covered by the
course with application in their study scientific domain. The development will be
performed incrementally over the course of the semester. First, students will identify a research question that
requires simulation of geospatial process or phenomena and exploration of system behavior under a selected set of
conditions. Second, students will be required to develop a methodological workflow and identify the appropriate
programming tools for implementation. Finally, the project culminates with a research presentation delivered to the
rest of the class at the end of the semester and a short paper. Documentation of the simulation tool and a live
demonstration will be required. The final design will be judged on methodological rigor, creativity, and presentation.
Grading rubrics will be handed out during the semester.

<h3>Proposal requirements</h3>
Preferably, work on your dissertation research focusing on its geocomputing or simulations component.
You can get inspired by the material covered in this course (see the course 
<a href="https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-simulations-course/topics/index.html">Topics</a>)
or the past projects with the titles listed further below.
You can use any suitable software tools or computing environments.
<p>
Project proposal should include the following sections:
Title, Introduction, Objective or research questions, Study site, Data,
Proposed methods and tools (any software or combination can be used), Expected results, References.
The proposal should be at least 2 pages long including references (feel free to write more if you are building upon 
 previous proposal) and include at least one image of your study site or data.
 Information about targetted scientific journal should be included.

<h3>Project progress and final presentations</h3>
Project progress presentation is 8-10 minutes, the final presentation is 15 minutes. The structure 
follows organization of the paper (see below). For the project progress presentation discuss
what still needs to be done and what may be holding you back. Also discuss how this project
and paper fits with your dissertation.

<h3>Paper requirements</h3>
<p>Structure and formatting should follow scientific journal standards, preferably for your
targetted journal. 
Please read and follow <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/11-steps-to-structuring-a-science-paper-editors-will-take-seriously"> 11 steps to structuring a science paper</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Text: minimum 4 pages, single spaced including tables and references</li>
<li>Figures: mininmum 2 pages, images, maps, graphs, all should have readable size, scale and legends where needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Organization of the paper
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Introduction/Background: brief literature review, motivation for the research, research question / objective</li>
    <li>Study site: where, why, geographic characteristics</li>
    <li>Data: sources, don't forget to discuss selection of resolutions, spatial extent</li>
    <li>Methods: describe methodology, highlight any new approach that you have developed </li>
    <li>Results and discussion: present and explain the qualitative and quantitative results,
        including tables, graphs, maps/images;
        compare with results from other studies (confirmed previously observed phenomena, showed something new,
        which questions remain unresolved</li>
    <li>Conclusion: summary of the most important findings including advances in methodology, future work</li>
    <li>References
    <li>Appendix: link to github, workflows, commands, scripts, metadata, software-specific issues</li>
    <li>Optional: Jupyter notebook, data repository, online tool</li>
</ul>

Further notes:
  <ul>
    <li>Use scientific language, this is a technical paper for experts in your field </li>
    <li>Spelling errors are unacceptable</li>
    <li>Images: use your own images/figures, make sure the figures are readable, use well designed color ramps, add scale bar and legends</li>
  </ul>
<!--
Throughout the semester, the students will develop and
implement a geospatial computing or simulation tool relevant for their dissertation research.
First, students will identify a research question that
requires geospatial computing or simulation of geospatial process or phenomena 
and exploration of system behavior under a selected set of conditions. 
Second, students will develop a methodological workflow and identify the appropriate
programming tools for implementation. The project results will be presented to the
rest of the class and summarized in a short scientific paper. Documentation of 
the geocomputing or simulation tool and a live demonstration will be required. 
The final design will be judged on methodological rigor, creativity, and presentation.

<p>
The following project assignments will be required:
<ul>
  <li>proposal (min 2 pages)
  <li>project progress lightning talk (5 min)
  <li>project presentation (15 min) 
  <li>paper (min 4 pages, Jupyter notebook optional)
</ul>

In addition to the required submissions, the students are encouraged to submit draft 
papers according to the schedule to recieve feedback on their progress, research direction
and writing. Information about targetted scientific journal should be included.

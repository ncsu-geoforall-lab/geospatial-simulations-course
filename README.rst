* Pandoc when using rst files


Build and publish
-----------------

The pages are build from the source code and placed into a separate directory.
Web page is published using GitHub pages. The publishing step is done
automatically.

Building the pages
++++++++++++++++++

In your clone of the repository where you are in master branch,
use ``build.sh`` script to build the pages.

::
    ./build.sh

The directory where pages are build is inside the directory with
the source code and is named ``build``.
You can look at the pages using e.g.::

    firefox build/index.html

If you don't see the changes you have made, delete the file in the build
directory and build again (the mechanism to recognize changes is not smart).

To build lectures go to the lecture directory and run the ``build.sh``
for lectures script there, i.e.::

    cd lectures
    ./build.sh

It is important to always be in the directory where the ``build.sh``
script is for each part.

Publishing the pages
++++++++++++++++++++

Once the changed and committed and pushed to the master branch, the
website will be deployed automatically using GitHub Actions.
